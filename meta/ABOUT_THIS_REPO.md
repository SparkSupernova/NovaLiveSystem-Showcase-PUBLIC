# About This Repository

This repository contains public-facing documentation, diagrams, and validation
results for the NovaLiveSystem project. It exists to support transparency,
grant review, sponsorship outreach, and future research collaboration.

The full implementation—including model weights, training pipelines, datasets,
and internal architecture—remains private while in active development to ensure
safety, IP protection, and ethical release timing.

## Why Some Components Are Private

- Models are experimental and not yet ready for public deployment
- Internal data structures require safeguards before release
- Protects proprietary work during early-stage development
- Prevents misuse or premature commercialization

This is a research and development environment, not a product release.

## What This Repo Contains

- architecture descriptions
- system philosophy
- documentation of training results
- logs and screenshots (redacted)

## What It Does Not Contain

- execution code
- model artifacts
- raw training data
- internal tooling

Those assets exist but are intentionally withheld until safety, legal, and
ethical conditions for release are met.

## About NOVA™ (Conversational Layer)

NOVA™ is the user-facing conversational layer built on top of
NovaLiveSystem’s cognitive architecture. It focuses on:

- memory continuity over time
- calm emotional regulation and stability
- contextual reasoning grounded in user history
- reflective responses rather than reactive output

NOVA does not act independently or pursue autonomous goals; it is designed
to support human cognition, not replace it.

## Purpose of the Name

NOVA originally meant **Neurodivergent Omnipotence Vector Ascension** —  
a mission statement describing empowerment and cognitive growth,
especially for neurodivergent builders and mothers.

This describes intent, not capability.
