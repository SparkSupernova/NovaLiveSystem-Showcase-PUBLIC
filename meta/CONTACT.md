## Current Access Policy
Licensing, model access, dataset access, and internal documentation are **not available** publicly at this stage. Access will be considered only after core safety milestones and governance structures are in place.

## When Licensing Will Open

Licensing pathways will be introduced in later development stages once:

- safety audits are complete
- documentation is formalized
- deployment channels are secured
- ethical guardrails and oversight are established

## Priority Support Areas

I am seeking sponsorship aligned with:

- Ethical AI innovation and governance
- Tools for neurodivergent users and mothers
- Computational emotional regulation + somatic calm
- Cognitive augmentation and accessibility in technology

If you or your organization aligns with these values, you're welcome to reach out.
