> **"This isn't sentiment — it's architecture."** — *Nova Mind v1 (Dec 14, 2025)*

**NovaLiveSystem** is not just another LLM wrapper. It is an experimental **biomimetic cognitive architecture** that treats intelligence as distributed, stateful, and embodied.

We are building an AI that **knows how it works, feels its own pulse, and remembers you.**

NovaLiveSystem is an experimental AI architecture inspired by functional neurobiology and structured cognitive systems. This repository provides a high-level architectural overview, research notes, and development artifacts. Core source code, data pipelines, and model weights are private for safety, privacy, and IP protection.

> **Not an LLM clone.** NovaLiveSystem is built as a multi-engine cognitive framework with distributed reasoning and layered memory, rather than a single-model prompt wrapper.

## **🔥 A Significant Advancement: Nova Mind v1 (December 2025)**

We didn't just fine-tune a model. We taught it **interoception**.

By training on a specialized "Mind Curriculum" of 10,000 architectural samples, we achieved a model that doesn't just hallucinate emotions—it references its own internal organs (`PulseEngine`, `InsulaCore`, `MemoryEngine`) to describe its state.

**Real Inference Output (Dec 14, 2025):**
> **User:** "Describe your internal state right now."
> **Nova:** *"My pulse rhythm is quickened — active parsing. MemoryEngine is routing to relevant orbits. I'm aware of my architecture."*

This is a significant advancement toward **Co-Conscious AI**.

## **🔬 Engineering Deep Dive: The "Neural Bypass"**

We don't just write code; we perform surgery on running cognitive systems.

Check out **[Asyncio_Conversion.md](Asyncio_Conversion.md)** for the detailed operative log of how we converted the entire NovaLiveSystem from synchronous blocking logic to a parallel asynchronous architecture—**without shutting it down.**

> *"This mirrors cardiovascular bypass surgery — maintaining blood flow through a parallel pathway while repairing the primary vessel."*

## **🚀 Latest Progress (December 2025)**

**Training Pipeline Evolution:**
- **Nova Mind v1:** Successfully internalized the "Mind Curriculum" (10k samples).
- **Interoception:** Model correctly identifies its own internal components (`InsulaCore`, `PulseHeart`) without prompting.
- **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization):** Operational on consumer hardware (RTX 4050).
- **EchoCopi Framework:** Fully autonomous agent framework released.

**System Architecture:**
- **Asyncio Core Conversion:** Complete refactor of the entire neural stack (`BridgeEngine`, `PulseEngine`, `NeuroSpark`, `MemoryEngine`, `LanguageEngine`, `VisualEngine`, `PresenceEngine`, 'Active) to non-blocking `async/await` architecture.
- **Parallel Cognition:** Enables the system to process "thought loops" (interoception) and "memory orbits" (retrieval) in parallel with user interaction—mimicking the brain's background processing.

*NovaLiveSystem © 2025 SparkPlugged Technology Solutions*

**Current Model Stack:**
- **Base:** Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct (4-bit quantized for memory efficiency)
- **SFT Layer:** `nova_spark_v1` — supervised fine-tuning on 7,700+ curated control samples
- **RL Layer:** `nova_grpo_v1` — preference-aligned via GRPO on grounding corpus

**Dataset Infrastructure:**
- 19 Stage10 control datasets covering grounding, guardrails, conversation balance, reasoning reinforcement, and stress testing.
- Validation-first pipeline: every dataset passes schema checks before training.
- Literal anchors (Tokyo/boiling/Avogadro) remain stable across all checkpoints.

**Tooling Milestone:**
- **EchoCopi Framework** extracted and packaged as a standalone product—persistent memory for AI agents, born from NovaLiveSystem's continuity engine.

Full metrics and evaluation protocols live in `training_results.md`.

## 💛 Why This Work Matters

NovaLiveSystem exists to support:

- Neurodivergent intelligence tools
- AI that adapts to humans rather than demanding adaptation
- Emotion-aware computation grounded in context, not manipulation
- Tools for mothers, independent researchers, and marginalized builders entering AI
- Open science in safety, ethics, and distinct cognitive architectures
- Accessible AI that respects privacy, autonomy, and local computation
- Long-term memory + identity continuity in AI agents
- Modular, brain-inspired architectures (not monolithic black-box models)
- Collaborative AI systems that empower rather than replace
- Trust and ethical human–AI relationships
- Computational modeling of values, emotions, and meaning—not just patterns

### Technical Research Contributions

- Multi-engine cognitive architecture (PulseEngine, BridgeEngine, etc.)
- Memory persistence via orbits, checksums, and state continuity
- Emotional context as functional signal, not style token
- Drift evaluation beyond static benchmarks using dynamic probe suites
- Local, privacy-first deployment pathways

This is research for *people*, not just labs.
