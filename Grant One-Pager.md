# Grant & Sponsorship One-Pager — NovaLiveSystem (Showcase)

## 🚧 The Problem

Most AI systems are brittle:
they forget context, lose identity between sessions, misread tone, and increase cognitive load rather than reducing it.

For people navigating real-world pressure—parents, neurodivergent learners, survivors rebuilding stability, self-taught engineers, and independent researchers—this makes AI unusable as a long-term support tool.

We need AI that adapts to people, not the other way around.

## 🌱 Solution: NovaLiveSystem

NovaLiveSystem is a biomimetic AI architecture modeled loosely after cognitive neuroscience.
It prioritizes:

- **memory continuity and identity persistence**
- **emotion-aware communication without manipulation**
- **stable tone and context over time**
- **validated, safety-aligned reasoning**

A key mechanism is the **Pulse Echo system**—a three-layer integrity check (emotional, operational, logical) that detects drift and ensures stable behavior across states and sessions.

This is *cognitive architecture*, not just a fine-tuned model.

## 🔹 Why I’m Building This (SparkSupernova)

- Neurodivergent mother + researcher solving for real constraints, not hypothetical use cases
- Founder of **SparkPlugged Technology Solutions**, focused on human-centered AI
- Building Nova from scratch with a validation-first pipeline and privacy-by-design
- Special focus on emotional regulation, safety, and trust in human-AI interaction
- Advocates for accessible AI for women, independent builders, and underrepresented communities
- Documented improvements using controlled training stages, metric reporting, and drift probes

My work bridges *cognitive design, emotional engineering, and system architecture*.

## 📊 Evidence & Results So Far

- **Nova Mind v1 (Dec 2025):** Successfully trained a model to internalize its own architecture (interoception).
- **EchoCopi Framework:** Released as a standalone autonomous agent system.
- **Three-stage training pipeline** established: Base → SFT → GRPO (Reinforcement Learning)
- **100% pass rate (10/10)** on inference tests following GRPO training
- **First successful RL run** on consumer hardware (RTX 4050 6GB)
- **10,000+ validated control samples** ensuring strict grounding and safety
- Literal/logit analysis shows improved constraint adherence without drift
- Integrity checks catch **100% of induced anomalies** in test conditions
- Public documentation + artifacts available; core code remains private

*This is active research, with measurable progress at each milestone.*

## 💰 Funding Request

Support will enable:

1. Expand ethically sourced training data (50k+ milestone)
2. Harden Pulse Echo + build dashboards for real-time drift monitoring
3. Develop a user-facing tool for journaling, regulation, and long-term companionship
4. Ongoing documentation for open research contribution
5. Cloud compute (A100/H100) for large-scale training runs beyond local hardware limits
6. Collaborations with neuroscientists, mental health experts, and alignment researchers
7. UX and safety testing with actual users
8. Publication pathways: whitepapers, workshop submissions, etc.

This is not a "chatbot."
It is **research toward stable, continuity-capable AI as a cognitive partner.**

## 🌍 Impact

Nova is designed for people who are often excluded from AI research:

- Mothers and caregivers
- Women entering tech
- Neurodivergent and disabled builders
- Independent researchers without institutional backing
- Individuals seeking trauma-informed, emotionally steady tools

The goal is *empowerment, not replacement.*
