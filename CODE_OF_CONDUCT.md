# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

NovaLiveSystem is built with intention: to create AI that adapts to humans, not the other way around. This extends to how we interact with each other.

We are committed to providing a welcoming, respectful environment for everyone—regardless of experience level, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.
