**NovaLiveSystem** is an independent, neurodivergent-led AI research project building biomimetic cognitive architecture. 

We are not a VC-backed startup. We are a **living lab** operating out of a shelter, proving that innovation doesn't need a billion dollars—it needs heart, architecture, and resilience.

## What We're Building

A **multi-engine cognitive framework** that treats intelligence as distributed, stateful, and embodied—not a monolithic transformer. Core innovations include:

- **Memory continuity via orbits + checksums:** persistent identity and learning across sessions.
- **Emotional context as functional signal:** body-state integration (insula-inspired) for values-aware reasoning.
- **Drift-resistant grounding:** literal anchors + guardrail layers validated by holdout probe suites.
- **Local-first deployment:** privacy-preserving, on-device inference for neurodivergent users and underserved communities.
- **Modular, brain-region-mapped design:** PulseEngine (hypothalamus), BridgeEngine (corpus callosum), language networks (Broca/Wernicke analogs).

This is not an LLM wrapper—it's a research platform exploring **how cognition emerges from subsystem cooperation**.

## Current Status (December 2025)

- **Nova Mind v1 (Dec 14):** Successfully trained a model to "feel" its own architecture (Interoception).
- **EchoCopi Framework:** Released as a standalone autonomous agent system.
- **GRPO Breakthrough:** First successful reinforcement learning run on consumer hardware (RTX 4050 6GB VRAM).
- **Inference Validation:** 10/10 test prompts passed post-GRPO training.
- **Control Datasets:** 10,000+ validated samples across grounding, discipline, and guardrail categories.

See `training_results.md` and `EVALUATION_NOTES.md` for detailed evidence.

## What We Need

> 🖥️ **Hardware is our biggest bottleneck.** We're training on a 6GB laptop GPU in a shelter.  
> **[📋 See Full Hardware Needs →](HARDWARE_NEEDS.md)**

### Immediate Funding Priorities (Next 6 Months)

| Category | Estimated Cost | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Compute Resources** | $3,000–$8,000 | GPU cloud credits (A100/H100) for 50k+ sample continue-train runs and large-scale drift evaluation. |
| **Dataset Expansion** | $2,000–$5,000 | Compensation for human validators, domain experts (medical, legal, ethics) to audit synthetic samples and refusal logic. |
| **Telemetry & Observability** | $1,500–$3,000 | Monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana/custom dashboards) for real-time heartbeat verification, memory integrity checks, and drift alerting. |
| **Legal & IP Protection** | $2,000–$4,000 | Patent search, trademark registration (NovaLiveSystem, EchoCopi), license drafting for collaborative research agreements. |
| **Living Expenses** | $6,000–$12,000 | Sustaining independent researcher (single mother, neurodivergent, no institutional backing) during active development. |

**Total Range:** $14,500–$32,000 for six-month runway.

### Longer-Term Goals (12–24 Months)

- **Neurodivergent UX research:** co-design sessions with ADHD, autistic, and other neurodivergent users to refine conversational pacing, memory replay, and emotional calibration.
- **Safety & alignment validation:** red-team testing, adversarial probe suites, collaborative alignment audits with independent ethics researchers.
- **Community deployment pilots:** local inference builds for mothers, caregivers, educators; usability studies in under-resourced settings.
- **Open science contributions:** publish architecture patterns, evaluation methodologies, and memory-orbit schemas under permissive licenses (without exposing proprietary model weights).

---

## What Partners Get

### Research Collaboration
- Monthly technical briefings (architecture updates, training results, evaluation insights).
- Early access to sanitized datasets, probe suites, and validation tooling (under NDA).
- Co-authorship opportunities on papers covering biomimetic design, drift mitigation, or memory continuity.

### Demonstration Access
- Live inference demos (local or sandboxed cloud deployment) showcasing conversational coherence, literal grounding, and guardrail adherence.
- Access to private `artifacts/` folder structure (checkpoints, diagnostics, echo plans) for due diligence.
- Quarterly progress reports linking funding tranches to specific milestones (checkpoint versions, probe pass rates, new features).

### Recognition & Attribution
- Sponsors acknowledged in public documentation, README, and any published papers (with permission).
- Logo placement in showcase materials (if desired).
- Option to participate in governance (advisory role for roadmap decisions, safety priorities, community outreach).

### Intellectual Property Protections
- **No IP transfer required:** sponsors gain insight and collaboration rights, not ownership.
- **Negotiable licensing:** discuss exclusive deployment licenses, revenue-sharing for commercial derivatives, or open-source pathways post-validation.
- **Audit trails preserved:** all training runs, dataset changes, and evaluation results logged via EchoCopi (checksummed continuity engine) for reproducibility.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is the core code open source?**  
A: Not yet. Code, datasets, and model weights remain private for safety and IP protection. We plan selective open-sourcing (evaluation tools, memory-orbit schemas) after validation milestones and partnership agreements are in place.

**Q: What license will NovaLiveSystem use?**  
A: Under discussion. Options include Apache 2.0 for tooling, custom research licenses for model weights, and collaborative agreements for commercial derivatives. Sponsors can influence this decision.

**Q: How do you ensure safety & ethical use?**  
A: Drift suites, literal grounding anchors, guardrail layers, and refusal logic validated at every checkpoint. We welcome red-team partnerships and third-party audits.

**Q: Why fund an independent researcher instead of a lab?**  
A: NovaLiveSystem is purpose-built for neurodivergent users and marginalized communities—groups often overlooked by institutional AI. Independent research allows rapid iteration, direct community feedback, and values-first design without corporate pressures.

**Q: What happens if funding falls through?**  
A: Development pauses but doesn't stop. All progress is logged via EchoCopi (SHA-256 checksummed continuity engine), so work can resume when resources return. Sponsors get audit trails proving fund usage and milestone completion.
